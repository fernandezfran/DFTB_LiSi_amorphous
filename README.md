# Content

The `structures` folder contains the structures of the amorphous LiSi system.
These where obtaines using [DFTB+](https://dftbplus.org/) and our previous 
[parameters](https://github.com/alexispaz/DFTB_LiSi) for this system. In 
`LiNSiM.xyz`, where `N` and `M` are the number of Li and Si atoms, respectively,
there is a frame in [xyz format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format) 
from which the simulation can be restarted. Also, in `LiNSiM.out` is the DFTB+ 
output of that frame with the box size and other thermodynamic information.
